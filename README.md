* Optionally, `python setup.py convert -t 500` to download and convert a reduced dataset for optional TensorFlow + Keras content

application optimization vs low-level optimization
Deep Learning only.

The plan. All of the material is based on the work of AI4sim team on a real-world use-case for ECMWF.


This is just an introduction, not a comprehensive, in-depth, hands-on material. 
Nothing optimized in low-level

This bootcamp was designed as. it contains assets
This material is an introduction to scaling
This bootcamp was delivered after a sprint of day-and-night work.

A few good-old ML-related resources:
