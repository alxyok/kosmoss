# kosmoss

## Content
What this is: a bootsrap to scaling mechanics.

What this is not: 
* A gentle introduction to Deep Learning or Machine Learning
* An in-depth look at cutting-edge innovations in AI


## Install
Prerequisites: valid [CUDA install](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

To install:
* `git clone` this repo and `cd` into it
* `python -m pip install .` to install this project as a library with its dependencies
* `python src/kosmoss/download.py` to download data for both PyTorch + Lightning and TensorFlow + Keras content

One note though
1. All of the material is based on the work of AI4sim team on a real-world use-case for ECMWF
2. This is just an introduction, not a comprehensive, in-depth, hands-on material
3. No low-level optimizations
