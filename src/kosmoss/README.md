This bootcamp is a 3-part sprint.
1. `dataproc` is a walkthrough over large file data preprocessing
2. `parallel` is an introduction to multi-x training in a cluster setup
3. `hyperopt` provides an overview of HPO in a general context

Each directory contains a set of challenges in the form of Python Notebooks and executable. They require internet access to download the data, and for candidates to be guided through the Reference APIs. 

For help, candidates should refer to solutions provided in the `solution` subdirectory for each part.
